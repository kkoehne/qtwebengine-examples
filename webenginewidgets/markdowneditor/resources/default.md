# Markdown Editor Example #

This example uses [QWebEngineView](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qwebengineview.html)
to preview text written in [MarkDown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
syntax.

## Acknowledgements

The conversion from markdown to HTML is done with the help of the
[markd js libary](https://github.com/chjj/marked).
The [style sheet](http://kevinburke.bitbucket.org/markdowncss/markdown.css)
was done by _Kevin Burke_.
